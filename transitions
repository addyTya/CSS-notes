use key word transition.

when we use transition we need to specify values for, transition-property, duration, timing-function and delay.
property is the keyword for any attribute such as color, background, width, transform etc/
duration is the time over which the effect will occur 
timning fucntion defines the type of transition you want 
and delay is the time before the transition starts

note: transition comes in effect when there is a chanage in value of the specified property 

p{
  width:50px;
  transition: width 1s;
}
p:hover{width:100px;}

on hover the value will change and the transition will be brought about!
